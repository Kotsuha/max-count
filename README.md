# max-count

For the game Lunatic Rave 2 (LR2)'s ranking website LR2IR.

理論値数___を超えている人をライバルしてるだけのIDです。

## How it works

## Known Issue / Incomplete Feature

Currently it cannot handle these cases:

* A max record that isn't a rank 1
* A max record that isn't on the first page of the song's ランキング view

Example cases:

* bmsid=122372 (bug)
* bmsid=2706 (ランダム分岐譜面)
